                            <h5>This is my first time, where do I start?</h5>
                            <P>It doesn't matter if you are a shy beginner or a hard-bodied veteran, we all do the same workout each class. If it is your first time, you may be slower than the more advanced athletes – but that’s OK. We all need to start somewhere, and the SWEAT community is encouraging and helpful – not competitive!</P>
                            <div class="clearfix space30"></div>
                            <div class="clearfix space15"></div>

                            <h5>I have no idea what these exercises are! How will I know what to do?</h5>
                            <p>That’s what we’re here for! Before each class the trainer will go over each exercise. And don’t worry – we’ll be guiding you along throughout your workout, making sure your form is correct, so you can get the maximum results!</p>
                            <p>That said, some folks do feel more comfortable with a <a href="http://sweatoften.com/#/private-fitness-training">one-on-one lesson</a> before their first class, and we can certainly accommodate that as well.</p>
                            <div class="clearfix space30"></div>
                            <div class="clearfix space15"></div>

                            <h5>What if I can't finish the class?</h5>
                            <p>Everyone is at different fitness levels. Things that come easy to some can be challenging for beginners. We make modifications for every exercise that allows for the same muscle groups to benefit.</p>
                            <p>And if you need to take a break in the middle of class, by all means do so! The best thing about HIIT training is that your body still burns calories – even at rest!</p>
                            <div class="clearfix space30"></div>
                            <div class="clearfix space15"></div>

                            <h5>Can I skip the cycling?</h5>
                            <p>Sure. We have a few clients that do what's called "double strength", where they spend the entire class doing the strength circuit. But don't think you're getting out of cardio – our floor work will usually get your heart rate up as much as the cycles do. Remember – our name is SWEAT.</p>

                            <h5>Do you do any kind of warm up or cool down?</h5>
                            <p>We do a brief warm up at the beginning of class, and encourage individual stretching afterwards.</p>
                            <div class="clearfix space30"></div>

                            <h5>I’m a woman, and I just want to get fit – not bulked up.</h5>
                            <p>Our workouts are designed to keep you moving through a series of exercises that will tone and sculpt your body. Given women’s low testosterone levels, the risk of bulking up is virtually non-existent.</p>

                                <li>Let us know of any pre-existing or new injuries before class so that we will have modifications ready for you. No injury is too small to mention.</li>
                                <li>Do not disturb the class during work intervals. Please wait for the “rest” bell before you cross the gym floor.</li>
                                <li>Be encouraging! Give hi-fives! Smile! Laugh! Make friends, and have fun. Exercise is the best form of stress relief.</li>

                            <h5>Do you allow walk-ins?</h5>
                            <p>We sure do! Just keep in mind that some classes sell out, so it’s better to reserve one – even if it’s right before the class. That said, we also usually have late-cancels or no-shows, so your chances of getting a spot are usually pretty good.</p>

                            <p>Originally from Cincinnati, Cassie's love of fitness and all things active began as a youth with ballet lessons and tee-ball games. She soon discovered that she enjoyed the conditioning aspect of practice better than the actual competition.</p>
                            <p>While attending college at Xavier University (Go Muskies!), she began her fitness career behind the front desk of a local gym – where she was able to take all the spinning, Pilates, and strength training classes that she could stand! And the seed was planted...</p>
                            <p>With now over 12 years of experience as a trainer, she’s earned multiple certifications in personal training and group fitness <a href="https://www.nasm.org/">(NASM)</a>, Pilates <a href="https://www.nasm.org/">(Power Pilates)</a>, and nutrition <a href="http://www.precisionnutrition.com/">(Precision Nutrition)</a>. And while she’s well-educated in the science of physical fitness, her training philosophy is simple – Being healthy should be fun!</p>
