                            <p><span class="big text-primary text-uppercase text-weight">Our Fitness Challenges and Contests</span> are a great way get motivated and achieve something awesome in a short time frame.</p>

                            <p>Our flagship program is <a href="https://clients.mindbodyonline.com/classic/home?studioid=167254" class="text-primary text-uppercase">SWEAT INTENSIVE</a> - a personal fitness and lifestyle program that includes</p>

                            <ul class="list-circle">
                                <li>Unlimited classes</li>
                                <li>Daily protein shakes</li>
                                <li>Individual diet plans and monitoring</li>
                                <li>Tracking of personal goals and metrics, and</li>
                                <li>Before and after "WOW" photos</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>It works like this – you'll first meet with one of the program leaders. We'll discuss your goals, take measurements and photos, and decide on a specific time frame for your program.</p>

                            <p>You can then take as many classes as you like (most folks do between 3 to 6 a week), and track your meals in the <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/" class="text-primary">myfitnesspal</a> app, which we monitor daily.</p>
                            <p>We'll then meet on a regular basis to take measurements, track progress, and address any challenges you encounter on your way to completing your SWEAT INTENSIVE.</p>

                            <hr class="article-sep">

                            <p>We also run <b>Structured Fitness Challenges</b> of varying durations (usually 8-12 weeks) throughout the year. Like the SWEAT INTENSIVE, these typically consist of initial weigh-ins, measurements, and photos, along with unlimited classes, and personalized nutrition and workout plans. You'll also have the option of incorporating supplemental protein products for even faster results</p>

                            <p>We'll meet weekly as a group in order to track progress, get advice and feedback, and provide each other with motivation and encouragement.</p>

                            <p>Want to <a href="https://clients.mindbodyonline.com/classic/home?studioid=167254">join a challenge?</a> Let any of us know after class, <a href="emailto:cassie@sweathealthfitness.com">email us</a>, or <a href="https://clients.mindbodyonline.com/classic/home?studioid=167254">sign up online</a>, and we'll set up an appointment for your initial measurements and photos. Any classes or packages that you currently have on your account will remain there for you to use after you complete the challenge.</p>

                            <hr class="article-sep">

                            <p>Our <b>Team Contests</b> are a free and fun way to stay accountable to your goals and meet new folks. We run these a few times a year as well, and everyone is eligible to participate!</p>
                            <p>Basically, we randomly divide everyone into teams and track TEAM participation (both in and outside of the studio) over a period of time – with great prizes for the winners of course!</p>
                            <p>On occasion, just for fun, we also put together teams for activities outside of the studio that we can do together (like the Tough Mudder and Spartan Obstacle Races, along with various distance runs and hikes -- and even brunches, happy hours, and parties).</p>
